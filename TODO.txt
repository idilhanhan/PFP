NOTES:
* login and sign up works at the moment
* Browse projects is fine, now i show more information about the single project
    NOTE -- in single project detail getUsername returns null but the database seems fine
* Search needs more work
* Add project works
* THE NAME AND ABSTARCT OF THE PROJECT BECOMES NULL, SAME WITH THE USER!!! -- i know how to fix this now!

TODO: hash function for the password
TODO: do the javafx interface
TODO:printing the keywords with the count of projects -- using raw query-- think about join and group by
TODO: think about how to make the proejct link work more smoothly with the queriries
TODO: Building JOIN Queries

Think About:
* work with the fx interface
* auto-completion; get the first word starting with the input user gave ; keyword consistency
* a way to edit the keywords later on --maybe just by the creator and participants

Report:
* also talk about object relational mapping -- explain what it is and why i used it
* and then talk about the ormlite and some
* i can include some code snippets in the report as examples
* maybe compare the use of an object relational mapping with hard coding!! -- you have the code for this in the backup
* you can also talk about the disdavantages
* you must deliver the code -- upload it to github!! add also as appendix
* at least 15 pages
